          [Verse 1: David Paich]
      I hear the drums echoing tonight
      But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
      She's coming in, 12:30 flight
      Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
      I stopped an old man along the way
      Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
      He turned to me as if to say
      "Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you"
      <br>
      <br>
      [Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
      It's gonna take the lot to drag me away from you
      There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
      I bless the rains down in Africa
      Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
      <br>
      <br>
      [Verse 2: David Paich]
      The wild dogs cry out in the night
      As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
      I know that I must do what's right
      As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
      I seek to cure what's deep inside
      Frightened of this thing that I've become
      <br>
      <br>
      [Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
      It's gonna take the lot to drag me away from you
      There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
      I bless the rains down in Africa
      Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
      <br>
      <br>
      [Bridge]
      Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you
      <br>
      <br>
      [Chorus: Bobby Kimball]
      It's gonna take the lot to drag me away from you
      There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
      I bless the rains down in Africa
      I bless the rains down in Africa
      I bless the rains down in Africa
      I bless the rains down in Africa
      I bless the rains down in Africa
      Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
